# FastAPI Docker Traefik Integration


## Overview
This project demonstrates a seamless integration of Python FastAPI, Docker, and Traefik for efficient web service deployment. It empowers developers to quickly set up, package, and serve web applications or APIs while ensuring scalability, security, and performance.

## Key Features
- **FastAPI:** A high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **Docker:** Containerization for consistent packaging and distribution.
- **Traefik:** A modern reverse proxy and load balancer for routing and SSL termination.

## Getting Started
